  <h1>A Brief Overview</h1>
  
  <p>
    My Simple-Polygons project is a simple Java program that creates three types of polygons. The program includes five class files. Three of the class files represent each polygon object that can be created. These files are Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle. There is also a class file titled Point. This class creates a "Point" object that 'points' to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a created "Polygon" object. The coordinates are based on a two-dimensional plane. Of course, one class file titled Lab04B contains the main class. This main class initiates several variables, arrays, creates objects, and produces output to the screen.
